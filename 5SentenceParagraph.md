####  Three details sentences:
     
     We brought freshly made ham sandwiches,apple pie and ice cold lemonade.
     While we enjoyed our picnic lunch under a tree,a small gray squirrel crawled close to us.
     Suddenly this squirrel grabbed my delicous piece of pie off my plate and scurried off.
     
####  Ending sentence:

     We couldn't believe this hungry squirrel had invited himself to our family picnic.
